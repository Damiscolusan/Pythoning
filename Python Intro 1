Basic Python while loop demonstration
Code to iterate through list dates and stop at the year 1973, then print out the number of iterations.
This can be done with the following block of code:
# While Loop Example
# while loop consists of initialization, condition and increment/decrement

import time# to slow the execution time
dates = [1982, 1980, 1973, 2000]
#i is the marker; it shows the addressor positions of the element in the list
i = 0                            # initilalization; the for-loop does not need initialization
year = 0                        # we used year as a checker and it initializes to 0
while(year != 1973): # condition
    year = dates[i] #year = dates[positions]
    time.sleep(6)
    i = i + 1           # increment or decrement
    print(year)

print("It took ", i ,"repetitions to get out of loop.")
# the time.sleep method delays the code a little bit
